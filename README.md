# Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!

Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We're thrilled to continue the tradition of offering engaging and accessible datasets for our community to hone their machine learning skills. Our goal is to provide interesting datasets that challenge participants to apply their knowledge and creativity in predictive modeling.

## About the Competition

### Objective:
The objective of this competition is to predict the age of abalone based on various physical measurements. Abalone is a type of marine mollusk, and predicting its age accurately can provide valuable insights for marine researchers and conservationists.

### Dataset:
The dataset provided contains a variety of physical measurements of abalone, such as length, diameter, and weight, along with the corresponding age of each specimen. Participants are tasked with developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the age of abalone based on these features.

### Custom Metric:
In this competition, we have introduced a custom evaluation metric to assess the performance of the models. This metric takes into account the unique characteristics of the abalone age prediction task and provides a more nuanced measure of model performance.
